You can see examples in many robotics kits, but humanoids use highly advanced versions.\n-   **Hydraulic Actuators**: These use fluid pressure to create incredibly powerful movements. They are famous for enabling the dynamic and powerful motions seen in robots like Boston Dynamics' [Atlas](https://bostondynamics.com/atlas/). However, they can be complex and messy.\n-   **Pneumatic Actuators**: Similar to hydraulics, but they use compressed air. They are often lighter and cleaner, but can be less precise.",

They can be standard cameras for visual recognition or stereo cameras that provide depth perception, similar to human binocular vision.\n-   **LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: This sensor spins around, shooting out lasers to create a 3D map of the environment. It's excellent for navigation and obstacle avoidance. You can learn more about how it works [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar).\n-   **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)**: These are crucial for balance. An IMU constantly measures the robot's orientation and acceleration, telling it if it's tilting or falling over. It's the same technology that lets your smartphone know which way you're holding it.\n-   **Force and Torque Sensors**: Placed in the robot's joints and feet, these sensors measure forces. They help the robot know how hard it's pushing on something or how much weight it's carrying, which is vital for stable walking and object manipulation.",
