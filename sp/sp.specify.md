## Feature: Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Guide

### 1. Overview
This project is to create a complete, step-by-step book that introduces beginners to the world of Physical AI Humanoid Robotics. The book will cover the hardware, software, mechanics, and ethical considerations behind creating human-like robots.

### 2. Requirements
-   **Target Audience**: Students, learners, and hobbyists who are beginners in robotics.
-   **Tone**: The writing style must be friendly, informative, and engaging, making complex topics accessible.
-   **Output Format**: The final deliverable is a full book written in Markdown (`.md`) files.
-   **Chapter Structure**: The book must include the following chapters:
    1.  Introduction to Humanoid Robotics
    2.  The Hardware of a Humanoid
    3.  The AI Brain
    4.  The Challenge of Bipedal Motion
    5.  Human-Robot Interaction
    6.  A Tour of Modern Humanoids
    7.  The Future and Ethics of Humanoid Robotics

### 3. Non-Goals
-   This guide will not provide advanced, university-level engineering detail.
-   It will not include hands-on coding tutorials, but may link to external resources.
-   The focus is on a broad, conceptual understanding, not on building a robot from scratch.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
-   A complete manuscript exists in Markdown format, with each chapter in its own file.
-   The content is clear, informative, and follows the friendly tone specified.
-   The guide successfully gives a beginner a comprehensive overview of the field of humanoid robotics.
