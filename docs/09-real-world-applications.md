title: 09 - Real-World Applications of Humanoid Robots
---

Humanoid robots are no longer confined to research labs. They are starting to be deployed in a variety of real-world applications, transforming industries and our daily lives.

## Healthcare

Humanoid robots are being used in hospitals to assist with tasks such as patient monitoring, medication delivery, and even companionship for the elderly. Their human-like form can make them more approachable and easier to interact with for patients.

## Manufacturing and Logistics

In factories and warehouses, humanoid robots can work alongside humans, performing tasks that are dangerous or physically demanding. Their ability to navigate complex environments and manipulate objects makes them well-suited for these roles.

## Disaster Response

Humanoid robots can be sent into disaster zones that are too dangerous for humans. They can search for survivors, assess damage, and perform other critical tasks, helping to save lives and mitigate the impact of disasters.
