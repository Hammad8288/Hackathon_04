title: 10 - Building Your Own Humanoid Robot
---

Building a humanoid robot is a challenging but rewarding endeavor. It requires a combination of skills in mechanical engineering, electronics, and software development. This chapter provides a high-level overview of the process and points you to resources to get started.

## Getting Started

For beginners, it's recommended to start with a kit or a well-documented open-source project. This will allow you to focus on the software and control aspects without getting bogged down in the complexities of mechanical design.

## Key Components

*   **Actuators:** These are the "muscles" of the robot. Servo motors are a popular choice for their affordability and ease of use.
*   **Microcontroller:** The "brain" of the robot. An Arduino or Raspberry Pi are good starting points.
*   **Sensors:** To perceive the world, your robot will need sensors such as cameras, accelerometers, and gyroscopes.
